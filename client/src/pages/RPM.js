To energizing music, hit the road with your coach who will take you on a course made up of hills to climb, sprints and flats. You control your resistance level and speed to improve your fitness over time.

The RPM™ is an excellent course to feel better in your body, sweat profusely, evacuate stress and secrete endorphins. Soak up the general atmosphere, pedal with the rest of the group in the peloton, attack when your instructor tells you to. Reveal the cyclist in you!</p>
