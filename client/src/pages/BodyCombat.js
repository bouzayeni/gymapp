Inspired by many sports and martial arts such as boxing, kickboxing, karate, capoeira or even Muay Tai, BODYCOMBAT™ will allow you to let off steam without counting the cost and regain your self-confidence.

Without consequences for your joints, the blows taking place in a vacuum, you will repeat series of movements such as strikes, punches, kicks and various jumps in order to gain agility and control of movement.

Finally, carried by the music and the group effect, you will maintain a high cardiovascular rate throughout the 45 or 55 minutes that this program lasts.</p>
